Hi👋, I'm Mohit Gohil, a versatile software professional🧑🏻‍💻 currently pursuing a Master's of Applied Computing Science at the University of Windsor and looking for co-op opportunities for Fall 2024. I bring over 1.5 years of combined internship and full-time job experience with a solid foundation in both full-stack development and data science."

• As a MERN Stack Developer Intern at APPMIXO BUSINESS INCUBATOR🌐, I crafted responsive user interfaces and developed robust REST APIs, significantly enhancing data management and visualization for our clients.

• At ADS MEDIA ENGINE🌐, I dove deep into Python, JavaScript, and React, developing a web application that revolutionized the management and organization of personal contacts, focusing on user-friendly features and seamless functionality.

• During my internship with GOEDUHUB TECHNOLOGIES💻, I worked alongside the data analytics team to optimize data processing times and improve strategic decision-making through advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

I am passionate about utilizing my skills to contribute to organizational growth and am always excited to connect with new people in the tech community. Let’s explore how we can drive technological advancements together!
